# easyPwdSprayer

For testing purposes, I developed a little ps1 snippet to spray several passworts against domain user account. Intention is to understand these type of attack on my personal Active Directory lab.

Maybe it helps you.

## Requirements

First of all, you need to know about your AD infrastructure. Are you able to import the Active-Directory module in Powershell? If so, you can easily run this snippet. If not, you have to do some extra miles to be able.

Later...

If you have all admin rights you need to have to run this script...
